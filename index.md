# About TinyPART

TinyPART aims to develop Software-Defined IoT building blocks for a deeply embedded software platform fitting low-power devices, architectured for privacy-by-design and cybersecurity. TinyPART seeks to provide both capabilities to isolate small runtime containers of untrusted (possibly scripted) IoT logic, and adequate privacy-oriented preprocessing (such as differential privacy and lightweight cryptographic tools) of IoT data on-board, before it is transferred from the OS to the container(s) and/or from the containers to the cloud. The goal of TinyPART is thus to explore tradeoffs between isolation guarantees, the logic orchestration functionality & security, memory footprint and ease of use by non-specialist embedded systems developer. In practice, TinyPART bases its embedded development on the open source operating system [RIOT](https://riot-os.org) and the protokernel [PIP](http://pip.univ-lille1.fr/).
